==Callback Functions==

A function passed into another function as an argument to be excused later

Synchronous callback functions - Code executes sequentially top to bottom.

Asynchronous callbacks - functions passed into other functions that wait for one part to finish to run the next 

Const process (callback) => {
Do something

Callback()
}
