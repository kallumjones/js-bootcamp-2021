==HTTP Post==

Fetch - may not be widely used, and xhr were used which is request and response. But the modern browsers use fetch and a lot of developers now use axios 

Every event listener will give an event as argument

Done through a form html element, similar use fetch and will need async and await if doing through fetch if we expect a promise will be returned.

GET should be used for retrieving data, not for posts this id due to a get will add information into the url, therefor POST should be used when posting data.
