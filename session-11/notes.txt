==Regex==

https://regexr.com/ useful test regex website

Regular expressions, Allows a way to search text that match what you would like to check, one of the main use cases if validation on the front end

Can be used in the majority of languages

Would generally define regex with const

Use two // to define regex, then the values in the middle are used

Flags can be added at the end of the /
g - global 
i - case insensitive	

Ways of writing regex

If you want to search for special characters can use \ followed by special character and this will then search for it (escaped character)

\w - matches any word character
\W - matches any non-word character (e.g. spaces)

\s - matches space
